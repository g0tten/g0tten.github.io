### The Gotten environment

We propose a model-driven engineering approach to automate the construction of Metamorphic Testing (MT) environments. Starting from a meta-model capturing the domain concepts, and a description of the domain execution environment, our approach produces an MT environment featuring comprehensive support for the MT process. This includes the definition of domain-specific Metamorphic Relations (MRs), their evaluation, detailed reporting of the testing results, and the automated search-based generation of follow-up test cases.

### The mrDSL language for the definition and execution of MRs

With that purpose, the Gotten environment provides a DSL called mrDSL to define and execute MRs. There you can declare the domain meta-models and the instance names used, the input features, that are defined by means of an OCL expression, the output features, the processors' attributes and the MRs. 

```
metamodel datacentre "/sample.gotten/model/datac.ecore" with m1, m2
models "/sample.gotten/model/dcmodels"
metamodel workload "/sample.gotten/model/workload.ecore" with w1, w2
models "/sample.gotten/model/workloads"

datacentre input Features {
	context DataCentre def: NNodes: Int = racks->collect(numBoards*board.nodesPerBoard)->sum()
	context DataCentre def: CPU: Int = racks->collect(
            numBoards*board.nodesPerBoard*board.nodeType.CPUCores*board.nodeType.CPUSpeed)->sum()
}
output Features {
	Time : Long
	Energy : Long
}
Processor {
	Name: String
	Version: String
}
MetamorphicRelations {
	MR1 = [(( NNodes(m1) > NNodes(m2) ) and ((w1) == (w2)) ) implies ((Time(m1) <= Time(m2)))]
	MR2 = [(( CPU(m1) > CPU(m2) ) and ((w1) == (w2)) ) implies ((Energy(m1) <= Energy(m2)))]
}

```

### The fowDSL language for the follow-up test cases generation

Gotten provides a DSL for the follow-up test cases generation called fowDSL. The followup-test cases generation method is based on [MOMoT](http://martin-fleck.github.io/momot/). There you can define the conditions of the followup-test cases generation for each MR. You can define for the corresponding feature the desired operations to increase/decrease numeric attributes or to create/delete objects, also setting the operation limits.

```
followups for datacentre using MR1
with source folder = "/sample.gotten/model/dcmodels"
and output folder = "/sample.gotten/model/dcmodels"

NNodes ->  decrease [1..4] Rack.numBoards keeping {Rack.numBoards > 0};
           decrease [1..4] Board.nodesPerBoard keeping {Board.nodesPerBoard > 0}

maximize ( NNodes(m2) - NNodes(m1) )

maxSolutions 10

```

### Authors and contributors

Gotten has been developed by [Pablo Gómez-Abajo](https://github.com/gomezabajo), [Pablo C. Cañizares](https://github.com/PabloCCanizares), [Alberto Núñez](https://github.com/albenune), [Esther Guerra](https://github.com/estherguerra) and [Juan de Lara](https://github.com/jdelara). At this point, we would like to thank the developers of the following frameworks, which we have used in order to develop Gotten:

- [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/): Xtext tailors the development of programming languages and domain-specific languages. With Xtext you define your language using a powerful grammar language.
- [Henshin](https://www.eclipse.org/henshin/): Henshin is used to formulate the transformation units to manipulate the model.
- [MOMoT](http://martin-fleck.github.io/momot/): MOMoT is a framework that combines MDE techniques with search-based optimization (population-based search and local search) to solve highly complex problems on model level.
